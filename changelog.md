# Changelog

Mirrored from [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/johncch/axle/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
in the library repository. For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrading](/upgrading).


## [0.30.2] - 2026-08-23

- Added support for OpenRouter streaming thinking deltas so reasoning output is handled correctly during chat completions.
- Added reasoning option support for prompt compaction, enabling thinking-capable model configurations during compaction.
- Updated available model definitions.

## [0.30.1] - 2026-08-13

- Fixed `PromptCompactor` progress reporting and summary handling so completed compactions are reported reliably without duplicating generated summaries.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-08-13

- **Breaking:** replaced agent-owned history with host-owned transcripts: use `agent.messages` for active conversation state and attach a `Transcript` to the event stream for persistence.
- **Breaking:** renamed `TurnAccumulator` to `Transcript` and updated the related transcript exports and persistence APIs.
- **Breaking:** removed built-in memory APIs and automatic recall/record behavior; use tools for model-directed memory and `Instruct.addContext()` for host-provided context.
- **Breaking:** removed session-level annotations and transcript state; annotations now belong to turns or parts, with session-wide application state kept by the host.
- **Breaking:** refactored compaction into trigger, policy, and compactor layers with stateful compaction parts and `compaction:update`/`complete`/`error` events; automatic compaction failures are now recorded without failing the user turn.
- Improved `PromptCompactor` progress reporting and summary handling so repeated compactions avoid reusing prior summaries.
- Updated the README, terminology docs, and 0.30.0 migration guide.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-08-05

- Added Qwen 3.7 Flash and Qwen 3.8 Max model definitions.
- Updated Qwen model metadata with larger output limits for selected Qwen 3.6 and 3.7 models.
- **Breaking:** renamed tool-loop terminology from “turn” to “step”: `maxIterations` is now `maxSteps`, `"max-iterations"` is now `"max-steps"`, stream events are now `step:start`/`step:complete`, and `generateTurn` is now `generateStep`.
- Added a 0.29.0 migration guide and terminology reference for the step/turn naming changes.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-07-27

- Added `agent.stop()` to stop an active turn at the next tool-batch boundary without interrupting in-flight work.
- Added `agent.clear()` to cancel queued agent operations while leaving the active turn untouched.
- Added `PromptCompactor` and automatic before/after-turn compaction triggers for easier long-session management.
- Improved compaction cancellation, history handling, and messages for repeated compactions.
- Updated available model definitions and fixed Gemini thinking configuration for newer Gemini 3.x models.

## [0.27.1] - 2026-07-17

- Added support for the Kimi K3 model.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-07-10

- Improved model registry support for clearer model selection.
- Updated TypeScript support and improved type narrowing definitions.

## [0.26.1] - 2026-07-09

- Fixed OpenAI tool schemas so optional properties are accepted correctly.
- Improved generation failure handling and exposed the clearer `AxleFailure` name while keeping `GenerateError` as an alias.
- Improved stream turn accumulation error handling for more reliable failures.
- Removed the Gemini 3.5 Pro model option.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-07-06

- Added experimental context compaction: `agent.onCompaction(callback)` supplies the policy and strategy, `await agent.compact()` triggers it. Active history is replaced; `agent.history` now exposes `messages` (active), `archive` (raw append-only), and `compactions` (receipts). Compaction renders as an agent turn containing a new `compaction` part and emits `compaction:start`/`compaction:end` turn events.
- Added `maxContextTokens` to `stream()`/`generate()`: a token budget for the tool loop, checked after each turn settles.
- **Behavior change:** loop limits are stops, not errors. `maxIterations` and `maxContextTokens` return `ok: true` with `stopped: "max-iterations" | "token-limit"` instead of an error result. Non-positive limits throw at call time.
- **Breaking:** `agent.history.log` is now `agent.history.messages`.
- **Breaking:** `agent.snapshot()` is now async; it waits for in-flight work to settle so snapshots are always at rest.
- **Breaking:** removed `Agent.restore()`; resume with `new Agent(config, session)`.
- **Breaking:** removed `index` from `StreamEvent`. Correlate tool events by `id`; text/thinking deltas belong to the most recently opened part.
- **Breaking:** removed the `createHandle` export.
- Added an `agent-compaction` baseline check exercising compaction end to end against live providers.

## [0.25.5] - 2026-07-03

- Add Claude Fable, Sonnet 5; Gemini 3.5 models

## [0.25.4] - 2026-06-17

- Improved `parallelize` handling for more reliable batched tool execution.

## [0.25.3] - 2026-06-16

- Fixed OpenAI file handling so filenames and URLs are resolved correctly.

## [0.25.2] - 2026-06-15

- Fixed tool calls with syntactically invalid JSON parameters so they are handled gracefully instead of failing.

## [0.25.1] - 2026-06-13

- Consolidate vendor options for ChatCompletions

## [0.25.0] - 2026-06-12

- Added a web search fallback for more reliable search behavior.
- Improved handling of non-text tool results.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-06-11

- Added experimental subagent tools for delegating bounded work to other agents, with child turn-event forwarding (`action:child-event`).
- Added experimental parallel tool execution for running batched tool calls concurrently.
- Added tool context helpers for reporting usage and adding contextual information during runs, including a flat per-provider/model `Stats.breakdown`.
- Added the `tool:exec-error` stream event for fatal/aborted tool calls; `Agent.on()` now returns an unsubscribe function.
- **Behavior change:** in `stream()`, a user-provided `onToolCall` returning `null`/`undefined` now falls through to executing the matching registry tool (matching `generate()`'s existing semantics) instead of producing a `not-found` result.
- **Behavior change:** a tool throwing an error merely named `AbortError` while the run's signal is live is reported to the model as an ordinary tool error instead of aborting the run.
- Fixed output fencing in generated content.
