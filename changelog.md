- Renamed provider option types and runtime parameters; see the [0.18.0 migration guide](/migration/0.18.0) for update details
- Updated usage stats to include cached tokens and thinking tokens

- Added vars mode to Instruct for easier variable-based prompting
- Fixed bugs found through live provider testing

## [0.16.2] - 2026-05-11

- Improved cancellation behavior by propagating abort signals through MCP tool calls

## [0.15.1] - 2026-05-08

- Added `AxleToolFatalError` for fatal tool failures, allowing generation, streaming, and agent runs to stop immediately without retrying or exposing the error to the model
- Fatal tool errors now preserve available partial output, messages, usage, and tool context for easier handling by applications

## [0.15.0] - 2026-05-08

- Abort operations now throw errors, making cancellation behavior easier to detect and handle

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-07

- Simplified the Agent and Instruct APIs for easier use and better TypeScript support
- Added support for binding inputs to Instruct templates with `withInputs`, `withInput`, and `clone`
- Improved template variable handling by consistently reporting missing required variables

## [0.13.0] - 2026-05-06

- Update distribution artifacts and config

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-05

- Agent now emits Turns, with an updated agent interface to match
- Agent history now carries both Turn and Message parts in parallel, improving fidelity when converting between representations
- Added configuration support to hooks
- Improved error semantics and error reporting for tool-call not found cases
- Fixed a bug where history could be incorrectly committed when a cancellation was in flight
- Updated to latest dependencies and models

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-22
