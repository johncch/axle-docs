# Changelog

Mirrored from [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/johncch/axle/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
in the library repository. For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrading](/upgrading).

## [0.34.0] - 2026-10-10

- **Breaking (CLI):** untrusted folders no longer load project `.axle/` configuration or credentials, and tools that can modify or execute (`exec`, `patch-file`, and `write-file`) are disabled until you run `axle trust` for that folder.
- **Breaking (CLI):** schedule commands now register jobs with `axle schedule add`; use `axle -j` for a proof run. `remove` and `sessions` select schedules by name.
- Added CLI skill discovery from user and trusted project skill directories; `axle info` reports loaded, shadowed, ignored, and invalid skills.
- Added experimental typed decisions with `decide()` and the `typesafe()` provider.
- Added live skill updates that take effect at the next provider request, plus safer skill-name validation and escaped skill output.
- Added per-provider custom fetch support and moved web-search configuration into provider tools.
- Added Agent `onIdle` callbacks, awaitable settlement hooks, queued-operation tracking, and cancellation support; snapshots now wait for the Agent to become idle.
- CLI chat now tracks queued sends and compactions as pending work, supports queuing input during a turn, and improves interrupt and session-settlement behavior.
- Added model-catalog context-window lookup and display in `axle info`; the CLI status bar now shows context use as a percentage. Removed `AXLE_CONTEXT_WINDOW`.
- Improved CLI credential loading and development-build version reporting, and removed the generic chat-completions provider from the CLI.
- Fixed OpenAI web-search citations that could crash core, and improved handling of dropped or malformed skill data.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-10-06

- **Breaking:** removed the model registry. The `@fifthrevision/axle/models` entry point no longer exists; pass model IDs as plain strings (`"openai/gpt-5.5"`), and OpenRouter IDs are sent unchanged.
- **Breaking:** removed `temperature`, `topP`, and `stop` from `generate()`, `stream()`, and agent request options; send them through `providerOptions` using the provider's own field names.
- **Breaking:** normalized provider tool parts across providers with portable `input` and `result` fields and per-provider `continuity`; added `provider-tool-result` content parts and `provider-tool:input`/`provider-tool:error` events, and removed `output` from `provider-tool:complete`.
- **Breaking:** provider refusals are now reported as a dedicated `refusal` failure kind instead of empty or mislabeled successes.
- **Breaking:** flattened failure results so `type`, `message`, `status`, and `usage` sit directly on `model` failures, and rejected API keys are detected as `type: "authentication"`.
- **Breaking:** removed `AxleStopReason.Error` and `AxleStopReason.Custom`; unknown stop reasons now fail the request.
- **Breaking (CLI):** local tools (`exec`, `read-file`, `write-file`, `patch-file`) are enabled by default in chat and recipes, and the `calculator` tool was removed. Add `tools: []` to keep a recipe tool-free.
- Added `axle info` to print the version, config files, defaults, and every configured provider, showing where each value came from and API keys only as set or unset.
- Added recipe scheduling on macOS: declare `schedule: { every: 1h }` or `at: "09:00"` in a recipe and use `axle schedule` commands to register, list, inspect sessions, and remove LaunchAgent-based runs.
- CLI replies now render as markdown (headings, code, lists, tables), prompts use GitHub CLI-style glyphs, and a default `axle-help` tool lets the model answer questions about axle itself.
- Thinking text now streams from Claude and OpenAI models when `request.reasoning` is enabled.
- Anthropic `pause_turn` responses continue automatically within a single step, with usage summed across the follow-up requests.
- Surfaced provider code execution output (stdout/stderr/exit code) in action results, newly enabled Anthropic code execution, and preserved Gemini code execution parts across turns.
- Kept Anthropic server tool results when a server tool runs alongside client tools, so follow-up requests no longer fail.
- Chat Completions HTTP errors now report the provider's error type and message instead of the raw status and body, and custom headers can be passed through provider client options.
- Agent session IDs are forwarded to OpenRouter so conversations stick to one upstream provider.
- OpenAI assistant items are replayed in their original order, fixing requests that reasoned between web searches.
- Adjacent text parts are joined without separators, fixing broken sentences and unparseable `Instruct` JSON.
- OpenAI responses cut off at `maxOutputTokens` and Anthropic's `model_context_window_exceeded` now finish with `length` and keep partial content.
- `web_search` resolves to newer provider versions, and Gemini searches now surface a `provider-tool` part with the queries used.
- Anthropic's implicit `max_tokens` default is now 128,000.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-09-12

- **Breaking:** renamed thinking stream events and separated displayable thinking summaries from raw reasoning content for clearer reasoning handling.
- Unified generation request handling for streaming transports, improving consistency between standard and streaming responses.
- Preserved OpenRouter and Gemini reasoning continuity metadata across generation, streaming, and assistant message conversion.
- Added portable controls for displaying, hiding, or retaining reasoning only for provider continuity.
- Improved usage reporting for OpenAI cached responses by tracking cache write tokens in standard and streaming flows.
- Fixed Gemini thinking/signature handling and related provider issues.
- Updated runtime support to require Node.js 22.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-09-08

- Added portable reasoning controls with named modes and effort levels, including validation and updated reasoning documentation.
- Redesigned `axle-cli` around interactive chat by default, with batch and resume commands, persistent sessions, and improved terminal rendering.
- Added CLI session resumption, automatic context compaction, and configurable compaction size controls for longer-running conversations.
- Added layered CLI configuration loading and validation, support for the v3 job configuration schema, and timestamped CLI log files.
- Improved CLI reliability for piped input, non-interactive runs, interrupted runs, failed batches, session cleanup, and credential handling.
- Updated available model definitions.

## [0.30.2] - 2026-08-23

- Added support for OpenRouter streaming thinking deltas so reasoning output is handled correctly during chat completions.
- Added reasoning option support for prompt compaction, enabling thinking-capable model configurations during compaction.
- Updated available model definitions.

## [0.30.1] - 2026-08-13

- Fixed `PromptCompactor` progress reporting and summary handling so completed compactions are reported reliably without duplicating generated summaries.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-08-13

- **Breaking:** replaced agent-owned history with host-owned transcripts: use `agent.messages` for active conversation state and attach a `Transcript` to the event stream for persistence.
- **Breaking:** renamed `TurnAccumulator` to `Transcript` and updated the related transcript exports and persistence APIs.
- **Breaking:** removed built-in memory APIs and automatic recall/record behavior; use tools for model-directed memory and `Instruct.addContext()` for host-provided context.
- **Breaking:** removed session-level annotations and transcript state; annotations now belong to turns or parts, with session-wide application state kept by the host.
- **Breaking:** refactored compaction into trigger, policy, and compactor layers with stateful compaction parts and `compaction:update`/`complete`/`error` events; automatic compaction failures are now recorded without failing the user turn.
- Improved `PromptCompactor` progress reporting and summary handling so repeated compactions avoid reusing prior summaries.
- Updated the README, terminology docs, and 0.30.0 migration guide.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-08-05

- Added Qwen 3.7 Flash and Qwen 3.8 Max model definitions.
- Updated Qwen model metadata with larger output limits for selected Qwen 3.6 and 3.7 models.
- **Breaking:** renamed tool-loop terminology from “turn” to “step”: `maxIterations` is now `maxSteps`, `"max-iterations"` is now `"max-steps"`, stream events are now `step:start`/`step:complete`, and `generateTurn` is now `generateStep`.
- Added a 0.29.0 migration guide and terminology reference for the step/turn naming changes.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-07-27

- Added `agent.stop()` to stop an active turn at the next tool-batch boundary without interrupting in-flight work.
- Added `agent.clear()` to cancel queued agent operations while leaving the active turn untouched.
- Added `PromptCompactor` and automatic before/after-turn compaction triggers for easier long-session management.
- Improved compaction cancellation, history handling, and messages for repeated compactions.
- Updated available model definitions and fixed Gemini thinking configuration for newer Gemini 3.x models.

## [0.27.1] - 2026-07-17

- Added support for the Kimi K3 model.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-07-10

- Improved model registry support for clearer model selection.
- Updated TypeScript support and improved type narrowing definitions.

## [0.26.1] - 2026-07-09

- Fixed OpenAI tool schemas so optional properties are accepted correctly.
- Improved generation failure handling and exposed the clearer `AxleFailure` name while keeping `GenerateError` as an alias.
- Improved stream turn accumulation error handling for more reliable failures.
- Removed the Gemini 3.5 Pro model option.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-07-06

- Added experimental context compaction: `agent.onCompaction(callback)` supplies the policy and strategy, `await agent.compact()` triggers it. Active history is replaced; `agent.history` now exposes `messages` (active), `archive` (raw append-only), and `compactions` (receipts). Compaction renders as an agent turn containing a new `compaction` part and emits `compaction:start`/`compaction:end` turn events.
- Added `maxContextTokens` to `stream()`/`generate()`: a token budget for the tool loop, checked after each turn settles.
- **Behavior change:** loop limits are stops, not errors. `maxIterations` and `maxContextTokens` return `ok: true` with `stopped: "max-iterations" | "token-limit"` instead of an error result. Non-positive limits throw at call time.
- **Breaking:** `agent.history.log` is now `agent.history.messages`.
- **Breaking:** `agent.snapshot()` is now async; it waits for in-flight work to settle so snapshots are always at rest.
- **Breaking:** removed `Agent.restore()`; resume with `new Agent(config, session)`.
- **Breaking:** removed `index` from `StreamEvent`. Correlate tool events by `id`; text/thinking deltas belong to the most recently opened part.
- **Breaking:** removed the `createHandle` export.
- Added an `agent-compaction` baseline check exercising compaction end to end against live providers.

## [0.25.5] - 2026-07-03

- Add Claude Fable, Sonnet 5; Gemini 3.5 models

## [0.25.4] - 2026-06-17

- Improved `parallelize` handling for more reliable batched tool execution.

- Fixed OpenAI file handling so filenames and URLs are resolved correctly.

## [0.25.2] - 2026-06-15

- Fixed tool calls with syntactically invalid JSON parameters so they are handled gracefully instead of failing.

## [0.25.1] - 2026-06-13

- Consolidate vendor options for ChatCompletions

## [0.25.0] - 2026-06-12

- Added a web search fallback for more reliable search behavior.
- Improved handling of non-text tool results.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-06-11

- Added experimental subagent tools for delegating bounded work to other agents, with child turn-event forwarding (`action:child-event`).
- Added experimental parallel tool execution for running batched tool calls concurrently.
- Added tool context helpers for reporting usage and adding contextual information during runs, including a flat per-provider/model `Stats.breakdown`.
- Added the `tool:exec-error` stream event for fatal/aborted tool calls; `Agent.on()` now returns an unsubscribe function.
- **Behavior change:** in `stream()`, a user-provided `onToolCall` returning `null`/`undefined` now falls through to executing the matching registry tool (matching `generate()`'s existing semantics) instead of producing a `not-found` result.
- **Behavior change:** a tool throwing an error merely named `AbortError` while the run's signal is live is reported to the model as an ordinary tool error instead of aborting the run.
- Fixed output fencing in generated content.

## [0.23.1] - 2026-06-08
